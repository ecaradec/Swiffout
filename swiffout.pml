			<Char_Desc_250>SwiffOut is a better way to play flash games without ads around, focus issue, speed issue and really fullscreen. It works with any browser and use tricks to makes flash game use your screen and your computer at their best. Try it, it's fun.</Char_Desc_250>
			<Char_Desc_450>I love playing flash games, some are little gems of gameplay. But I really dislike the experience of playing in a browser. You play in a thumbnail surounded by blinking ads, sometimes you click outside the flash and loose focus at a bad time. Not fun. SwiffOut extract the game from the browser completly, load it in another window, resize the screen to a smaller size and maximize your game experience. Sound silly, not that useful ? Try it, really.</Char_Desc_450>
			<Char_Desc_2000>I love playing flash games, some are little gems of gameplay. But I really dislike the experience of playing in a browser. You play in a thumbnail surounded by blinking ads, sometimes you click outside the flash and loose focus at a bad time. Not fun.

Some Firefox extensions try to solve this problem by maximizing the flash over the whole browser. It's better, but it still doesn't really feel like fullscreen. Browser menus and address input field are visible at the top of the screen. If you move the mouse too high you click on it instead of the game. Even worse, flash is not fast enough to draw over such a large surface like the whole desktop. Fast games are slowed down to a crawl.

Hence you have to choose between playing in a thumbnail or playing with menus at the top, focus issues and speed issues. SwiffOut extract the game from the browser completly, load it in another window, resize the screen to a smaller size and maximize your game experience. Sound silly, not that useful ? Try it, really. Flash game really feel like they are desktop games. Oh ! And it works in any browser too.</Char_Desc_2000>
