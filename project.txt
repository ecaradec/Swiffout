todo

x conserver le ratio (at small size zoo doesn't work well and we can see debug info - size should be the one of the browser to avoid issues )
x check resolution closest to the game
x fix crash on exit
x make a licenciable version
x check email work
x verifier si les parties sont sauvegardée
x faire naviguer le jeu vers une page vide pendant le lancement du jeu avoir un bouton retourner au jeu (pour eviter de consommer le CPU )
- allow to quit the game with esc ?
- do something if the game doesn't load
- get a ejunkie account

I really love playing flash games, some are small gems of gameplay. <If you don't believe me try http://www.ninjakiwi.com/Games/Bloons-Games/Play/Bloons.html or http://armorgames.com/play/5151/civilizations-wars>

But I really disliked the experience of playing in a browser : you play in a thumbnail, surrounded by blinking ads. Some browser extensions try to remove those, but it's not real fullscreen still, sometimes it scroll or the menus appears. Also it only works in Firefox and it's not the browser I use.

<b>SwiffOut allows you to play flash games REAL fullscreen, no focus problems, no menus, no ads.</b>

The demo version last for 30 days. I think you'll like it as I do.

- because many flash games have great gameplay
- because it's not nice to play in a small window surounded by ads
- because the browser window scroll at bad time, or loose focus and disrupt the game
- because you bought this new wide screen and it's too bad to play in a thumbnail
