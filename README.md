*Swiffout is mostly unusable now. It relied on a native executable and it's mostly impossible to do now because of the security of the browsers.*

Swiffout is a browser addon that allows to play flash games as if they were desktop games.

Chrome, Firefox and IE extensions are all contained in that repository, so is the native component and installer for IE.
